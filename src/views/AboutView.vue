        I am a full-stack web developer with a passion for creating
        beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I have a
        background in marketing and sales, which has given me a unique
        perspective on how to create websites that are not only visually
        appealing but also drive results.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js. I am also
        familiar with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I am constantly
        learning new technologies and improving my skills to stay up to
        date with the latest trends in web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I am not coding, you can find me hiking, playing guitar, or
        reading a good book. I am always looking for new challenges and
        opportunities to grow as a developer.
